**Title:** Semantic and Instance Segmentation of Agricultural Parcels Using the PASTIS Benchmark Dataset

**Abstract:**

This project develops a state-of-the-art solution for semantic and instance segmentation of agricultural parcels from satellite image time series using the PASTIS benchmark dataset. The proposed approach utilizes a deep learning model to extract valuable insights from the big geospatial dataset, capturing spatio-temporal information and achieving high levels of precision and accuracy. The code for this project provides a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline for training and evaluating the model, including data cleaning, fetching, pipeline development, exploratory data analysis, automated pipeline design, deep learning model selection, model fine-tuning, data visualization, pseudocode and algorithm design, handling geospatial data, and reflections on learnings.

**Key Requirements:**

* Big Data Analysis
* EDA for Data Selection
* Automated Pipeline for Model Training
* Deep Learning Model Selection with Mathematical Reasoning
* Model Fine-Tuning
* Visualization of Data
* Pseudo Code and Algorithm Design
* Handling Geospatial Data
* Learnings, Both Pros and Cons

**Installation:**
